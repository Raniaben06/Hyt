00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'll give you all my love

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hey, Tong!

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You're in big trouble, Tong.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Don't worry, Kit.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What? You want N'Pup to continue?

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes, Mr.Wikit is really interested in N'Pupla.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This woman is so smart to add value to herself with me.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hey, son. I'm glad you know how to enjoy your life.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Just sitting in the car two by two, I'm close enough.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Remember this, even if you bring money to the world,

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
you will never touch me.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I told you not to gossip about all the women who work like this.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Some people may not be what you think.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's because of your father that I've changed my mind since then.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And it won't change easily.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Mr. Palapol told the police that he hurt Pete

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
because he was not happy to see Pete using a phone camera to take pictures behind a woman's bathroom.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
How's it going?

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Help me check all the CCTVs and buy them all.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't let Pete be a spy.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hey, so is this true?

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Pete is still young. He will learn soon.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If you let him be a spy, he will learn.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't want him to be a spy.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't want him to be a spy.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't want him to be a spy.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Pete is still young. He will learn soon.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If you let him be a spy, he will learn.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't want him to be a spy.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Do you understand?

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes, I do.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Do you understand?

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Go and bail him out.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Thank you so much.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You don't have to. I don't mind.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I can't. It's my debt.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The old debt that you borrowed from Mr. Suthee can't be used up.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Don't forget that you are Mr. Suthee's debt.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll pay you back when I have the money.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Please excuse me.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Thank you again.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Hey, Prap.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Ton.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm sorry I'm late. I just finished my message.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But when I saw your message, I came right away.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's okay. Thank you so much.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
How are you?

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Are you still defending Tong?

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Do you want me to take care of him?

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's okay. I'm here now.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm just waiting for the result.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
How are you, Nut?

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The relative of the person who was attacked by Tong

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
has refused to defend himself.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Do you know who your brother attacked?

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's none of your business.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's none of your business.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Who?

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Tonlek's son, the owner of PP World.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What?

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You refused to defend the kid who had an affair with Pete?

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's a strange question.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
They only hurt Pete. They have to pay for it.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What happened?

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You should ask Pete first what happened.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't blame him for this.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But Pete didn't do anything wrong. Why do you have to ask?

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This is what they call my stepfather.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
As a mother, what did I do wrong to protect Pete?

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If this happened to Pete, I would have to protect him too.

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's not necessary. You are not my mother.

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And a woman like you has no right to compare with my mother.

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Remember that.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's right. I can't compare with your mother.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Because I'm not the kind of mother who can give birth to her own child.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Or what I said is not true.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
As a mother, no matter how hard it is,

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
the last thing a mother shouldn't do is giving birth to her own child.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
P'Pim.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Sang.

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Have you had breakfast?

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Today, I have your favorite Bak Kut Teh.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So I asked him to join us.

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Wow, you have my mouth already.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Are you in a hurry?

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
My father is going to see a foreign event.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Let's sit down.

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Come on, P'Pim. I'll cut it for you.

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The taste is amazing.

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No Bak Kut Teh is as delicious as your cooking.

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You are so sweet.

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But today, it's not my cooking.

102
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's this person's cooking.

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm very surprised.

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The taste is not different from Aunt Pond's.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's very delicious.

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I have already sold my land to my relatives.

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
From now on, I will leave my belly at this house.

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Until I get old.

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Please take care of your future girlfriend.

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You have an old brother to eat with you at home.

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You won't be able to sell it.

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll wait for you.

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's eat, dear.

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It will get cold.

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay.

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let's eat.

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll take you to your house.

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay.

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Grandma, where are you going?

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Grandma.

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Grandma.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I have to apologize.

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Apologize to my parents for hurting him.

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm afraid that he will be soft-hearted and let me go.

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Grandma.

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's my fault that I didn't raise him well.

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I have to apologize to my parents.

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm afraid that he will be soft-hearted and let me go.

129
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Do you know where their house is?

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't know.

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You are at P'Pewo's house.

132
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Why are you looking for trouble?

133
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Come out.

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If I don't come, my grandmother will come anyway.

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I won't let my grandmother do that.

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Are you going to apologize to her?

137
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What do you want me to do?

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
My brother didn't hurt him.

139
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
If there's anything I can help, I want to do it.

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm just calling to tell you where I am.

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
In case I disappear.

142
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Crazy.

143
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay, I'll call you back when I'm done.

144
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay.

145
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
As a mother,

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
no matter how hard it is,

147
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
what you shouldn't do the most

148
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
is abandon your child.

149
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Mom.

150
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Mom.

151
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Khun Pim.

152
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Are you back from the camp?

153
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Give me your bag.

154
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What about your mother?

155
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Your mother ran away.

156
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What are you talking about?

157
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Where is she?

158
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't know.

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I saw her packing up when I came back.

160
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's just a letter.

161
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm sorry I have to do this.

162
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But if the child is with his father,

163
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
it would be better than having a hard time with me.

164
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But if everything is in its place,

165
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I will take my child with me.

166
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Please bear with me.

167
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I can't stand it anymore.

168
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Khun Pim.

169
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Why do you

170
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
have to give up a worthless woman like Su?

171
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But I won't.

172
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I hate women like this the most.

173
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Come in.

174
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Khun Pim, someone wants to see you.

175
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Who?

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Her name is Pla-Pla.

177
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This woman is no different from Su.

178
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
She looks like trash.

179
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I want to apologize

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
explain everything.

182
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Is this

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
your way of apologizing?

184
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't understand your feelings at all.

185
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm sorry on behalf of my brother.

186
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Is that all?

187
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yes.

188
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm sorry on behalf of my brother.

189
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Is that all?

190
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Is that all you want to say?

191
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You don't have a good mouth.

192
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I've heard that

193
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
a family is like a double-edged sword.

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Even though they are good at fighting,

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
they grow up together.

196
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
If someone does something wrong,

197
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
the family should be responsible for it.

198
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I didn't take good care of my brother.

199
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I apologize on behalf of him.

200
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You are

201
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
a generous person.

202
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But I'm sorry.

203
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm not the kind of man who will fall for a woman like you easily.

204
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
If you want me to pay you back, just tell me.

205
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Are you trying to get money from me?

206
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Do you think you have enough money?

207
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Khun Pim,

208
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I haven't talked about money yet.

209
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I know that my money can't pay you back.

210
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Especially for a rich man like you.

211
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You are really good at tricking people.

212
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So are you here to trick me

213
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
or make me angry?

214
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I just want you to tell me

215
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
how you want me to pay you back.

216
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm willing to do anything.

217
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Then

218
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
do what

219
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
a woman like you is good at.

220
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Sleep with me.

221
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Hey,

222
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm just thinking about what you said

223
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
in front of me in the middle of work. Do you remember?

224
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Do you remember?

225
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
A man like me

226
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
even if you bring money to the world,

227
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
you will never touch me.

228
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
In front of others,

229
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
you are a good woman who doesn't want to sell her dignity.

230
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But when you get paid, you do one more thing.

231
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And you still have the face to scold me for working in front of others.

232
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Do you think I can forget about this easily?

233
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
This is the time

234
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
that I will teach a woman like you.

235
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You are so evil.

236
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I think you'd better keep your mouth shut

237
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
before I have something harder to do.

238
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's even harder.

239
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You can think about it

240
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
if you will do as I say.

241
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I give you

242
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
midnight.

243
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
If not,

244
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
prepare to wait for your brother

245
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
to go to jail.

246
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Tong.

247
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
P'Pup.

248
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
P'Pup.

249
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I haven't been able to bail you out yet.

250
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The other party hasn't come out yet.

251
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Let's forget about that.

252
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
How is that evil guy?

253
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
He's still in the hospital.

254
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I told you

255
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
to go home after school.

256
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Why did you go out drinking like this?

257
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
P'Pup.

258
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I just went out to celebrate after the exam.

259
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Why are you nagging me?

260
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Even though I nag you,

261
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I still have to worry about you and Ya.

262
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
If I don't nag you, how bad will it be?

263
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Malak.

264
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm here.

265
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Can I ask you first

266
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
what happened?

267
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Why are you nagging me?

268
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I don't want to nag you.

269
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But every day,

270
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
you have to make things up for me.

271
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Malak.

272
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Calm down.

273
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Calm down, both of you.

274
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What happened?

275
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
How did that happen?

276
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Actually, Tong told the police.

277
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
But I don't understand why she's not guilty.

278
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Why is she the only guilty one?

279
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Because we don't have evidence to prove that she's guilty.

280
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
They rejected every word Tong said.

281
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Hey, Tong.

282
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Is there anyone who can testify for us?

283
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The one who saw the incident where those guys secretly asked women.

284
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's just them.

285
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
No one else.

286
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
If so,

287
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
the only way I can help you is

288
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
to find the evidence

289
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
when those guys secretly asked women, right?

290
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Hold on, Pup.

291
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Where will you find the evidence?

292
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't know yet.

293
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But I won't give up.

294
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Leave me alone.

295
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'll go do something.

296
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Then tell me where the evidence is.

297
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Hey, watch out.

298
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Tong.

299
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Tong.

300
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yan.

301
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Tong.

302
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yan.

303
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Wake up.

304
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yan.

305
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Wake up, Yan.

306
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Hey, Pete!

307
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What's going on?

308
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That's all, Mr. Lawyer.

309
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Did anyone see anything going on between them?

310
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
No.

311
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And Pete and his gang are regular customers.

312
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
They're all close.

313
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
They've never had anything to do with anyone.

314
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I think you should ask your friend.

315
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Well, I didn't see anything.

316
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I walked in and saw a man unconscious.

317
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm so hurt.

318
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
If I had recorded the sound of him threatening me,

319
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I wouldn't have been famous all over the country.

320
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
My future would be ruined.

321
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You bastard!

322
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Come on.

323
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
My dad used to teach me that

324
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
if you haven't reached the end yet, don't give up.

325
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Even if we can't find a way to fix it,

326
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
it doesn't mean it won't get better.

327
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'll fight until the end.

328
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'll go get something to drink.

329
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Do you want anything?

330
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
No.

331
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Okay.

332
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Two minutes left.

333
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Okay.

334
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Here it is.

335
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Your true self.

336
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
This way.

337
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You're his sister, right?

338
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yes.

339
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm his brother.

340
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm his sister.

341
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm his brother.

342
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm his brother.

343
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You're such a good sister.

344
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You're willing to be a freebie

345
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
in exchange for his freedom.

346
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Oh, I forgot.

347
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You must have been used to this kind of easy-to-solve problem.

348
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
In the past, you must have been

349
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
in trouble with this kind of substitution all the time.

350
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Being a woman like you,

351
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
life is so easy.

352
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Maybe it's because

353
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I can't choose.

354
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Shall we start?

355
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Let's start.

356
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Actually,

357
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I've never seen a woman like you

358
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
from a distance.

359
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But this time,

360
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
let's pretend that I'm a woman like you.

361
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I think

362
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
it's more like your role.

363
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Pete.

364
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Pete.

365
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
If the reporters get this clip,

366
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
they will see that your brother

367
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
has a problem.

368
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
In addition to your company having a problem,

369
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
your family name will be ruined.

370
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Because people will think

371
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
that you are from a rich family.

372
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
How did you get this clip?

373
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Excuse me.

374
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Can I see the camera in front of the car?

375
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
My brother was arrested.

376
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So I want the CCTV footage to help him.

377
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Yes, sure.

378
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Can you see him?

379
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Yes, I can see him.

380
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Let's go.

381
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Have you decided yet?

382
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Who will get the role?

383
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Give it to me.

384
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Stop it.

385
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Actually,

386
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
the person who did it

387
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
shouldn't be my brother.

388
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But your brother

389
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
and yourself.

390
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So what are you going to do?

391
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Do you still want my brother?

392
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
What do you want

393
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
in exchange for this clip?

394
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
You are an entrepreneur.

395
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You are good at negotiating.

396
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You shouldn't let me tell you

397
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
what I want.

398
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You want me

399
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
to let go of your brother.

400
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Yes.

401
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
This case is a criminal case.

402
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Even if I don't let go of your brother,

403
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
the police will still sue you

404
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
for your brother hurting my brother.

405
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But the punishment should be reduced.

406
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
My brother shouldn't be in jail.

407
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
At least I can bail him out.

408
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Is that okay?

409
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I agree.

410
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What else?

411
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It was about my brother.

412
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
This time,

413
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
it's about me and you.

414
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Why did you take a photo of me?

415
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Why did you take a photo of me?

416
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Hey,

417
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
go stand on the balcony.

418
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
What?

419
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Are you going to go or

420
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
do you want me to press the share button?

421
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Huh?

422
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Are you going to go or not?

423
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Go!

424
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Open the door and go outside.

425
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Huh?

426
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Go outside?

427
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yes.

428
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Hurry up.

429
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Or I'll press the button.

430
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Hurry up.

431
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm really going to press it.

432
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Are you happy now?

433
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
No.

434
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
What else?

435
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Boxer?

436
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Huh?

437
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Boxer?

438
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Are you crazy?

439
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'm not crazy.

440
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'll take it off.

441
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I can do it.

442
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Hurry up.

443
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I'll count from one to three.

444
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
One.

445
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Two.

446
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
That's enough.

447
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Three.

448
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Are you crazy?

449
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
That's enough.

450
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Are you happy now?

451
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Almost.

452
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
A little bit more.

453
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Four.

454
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Five.

455
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Six.

456
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Seven.

457
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Eight.

458
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Nine.

459
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
10.

460
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
11.

461
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
12.

462
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000

463
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
100.

569
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
100.

570
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
100.

571
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
100.

572
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
100.

573
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
100.

574
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
100.

575
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
100.

576
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
100.

577
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
100.

578
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
100.

579
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
100.

580
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
100.

581
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
100.

582
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
100.

583
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
100.

584
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
100.

585
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
100.

586
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
100.

587
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
100.

588
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
100.

589
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
100.

590
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
100.

591
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
100.

592
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
100.

593
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
100.

594
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
100.

595
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
100.

596
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
100.

597
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
100.

598
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
100.

599
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
100.

600
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
100.

601
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
100.

602
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
100.

603
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
100.

604
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I don't think he likes to drink fish sauce.

605
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You know what?

606
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm going to threaten him to sleep with me.

607
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
If it's me, I'm going to be mad.

608
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You know that I don't care about that kind of woman.

609
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I just pretended to threaten him.

610
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I just pretended to sleep with him.

611
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I didn't really want to sleep with him.

612
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It really hurts.

613
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I think that after I pranked that woman,

614
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I'm going to call my dad.

615
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Don't you think it's too much?

616
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Or do you really like him?

617
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Stop kidding me.

618
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I don't have feelings for that kind of woman.

619
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I just want to prove to my dad that I'm not wrong.

620
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Tong.

621
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Tong, my granddaughter.

622
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
My granddaughter.

623
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm here for you.

624
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm here to take care of you.

625
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I'll give you everything.

626
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I'll give you everything.

627
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I'll give you everything.

628
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I'll give you everything.

629
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I'll give you everything.

630
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'll give you everything.

631
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I hope that he won't be mad at you.

632
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I hope that he won't be mad at you.

633
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Ms. Pim.

634
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
A police officer came to see you.

635
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
What's his name?

636
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
He left this for you.

637
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
He left this for you.

638
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I'm sorry.

639
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I've kept my promise.

640
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I hope you won't forget it.

641
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I hope you won't forget it.

642
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Let's break up.

643
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Let's break up.

644
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I don't want to mess with you.

645
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I don't want to mess with you.

646
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Mr. Pim.

647
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You're the one who told our lawyer

648
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
not to take the evidence from the person who hurt Pete.

649
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Yes.

650
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Why?

651
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
If you want to know,

652
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
watch the video.

653
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Pete.

654
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Pete.

655
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Why didn't you sign the renovation project

656
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
at the hotel in Phuket?

657
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I haven't checked the document.

658
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I'm the president of the company.

659
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I've checked it.

660
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You signed it.

661
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Pete has woken up.

662
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Don't you want to visit him?

663
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
He will be upset.

664
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm your father.

665
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
You don't have to do this.

666
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I just hope so.

667
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I just don't want him to feel bad about his father

668
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
like I did.

669
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Oh, Mr. Pim.

670
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Aren't you going to have breakfast?

671
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm sorry, Ms. Parichart.

672
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm not hungry.

673
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
How many words can you say at a time?

674
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Look at her.

675
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
She's always picking on me.

676
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You're such a pain in the ass.

677
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Na.

678
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
What are you doing?

679
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Why are you hitting me?

680
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You're hurting me.

681
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Hey.

682
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
If my father finds out,

683
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
he will be so mad.

684
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
That's good.

685
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But I don't think

686
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
he will care.

687
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
You're his son.

688
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
How can he not care about you?

689
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Mom.

690
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I'm not your son.

691
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I'm just your mistake.

692
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Don't forget

693
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
if it wasn't for me,

694
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
you wouldn't have left him.

695
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
When will you stop thinking like this?

696
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's not true.

697
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I feel so guilty about Pim.

698
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
She's so nice to him.

699
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
But in the end,

700
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
she left him because of Pim.

701
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
You idiot.

702
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Pim is nice to you

703
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
because she wants you to be her son.

704
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
She wants you to be a slave to her.

705
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
So you won't dare

706
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
to steal her property.

707
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
She doesn't really love you.

708
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
How can you feel guilty?

709
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's not true.

710
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Pim loves him.

711
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Why? Don't you hate me?

712
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Think about it.

713
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
You can't even have a son.

714
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I told the lawyer to try to

715
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
solve this as soon as possible.

716
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Including deleting the video.

717
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Good.

718
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
At least Pete is my son.

719
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It's interesting

720
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
that a girl

721
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
can do this to Pim.

722
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I love you.

723
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Are you hurt?

724
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You!

725
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
What kind of guy is he?

726
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
He's handsome and kind.

727
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
He's a pervert.

728
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
You have to pay me back

729
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
within a week.

730
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Remember that.

731
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Hello.

732
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
The audience would like to meet you.

733
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Hello.

734
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I heard that you're looking for a job.

735
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Are you interested

736
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
in working here?

737
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Who is she?

738
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
She doesn't have an interesting profile.

739
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
She's not ordinary.

740
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
What's her name?

741
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Prapra.

742
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
That's strange.

743
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
She's more interesting.

744
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Prapra.

745
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Prapra.

746
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Prapra.

747
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Prapra.

748
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Prapra.

749
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Prapra.

750
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Prapra.

751
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Prapra.

752
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Prapra.

753
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Prapra.

754
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Prapra.

755
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Prapra.

756
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Prapra.
